# holbertonschool-printf
Project about our own function _printf that produces output according to a format. Pair programming by Natalia Heredia and Tania Cauich.

_What is printf?_ It writes the C string pointed by format to the standard output (stdout).

_Conversion specifiers_ Characters that specify the type of conversion to be applied.

d, i: The int argument should be signed decimal notation, and the resulting number is written.

c: The int argument is converted to a char, and the resulting character is written.

s: The const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
